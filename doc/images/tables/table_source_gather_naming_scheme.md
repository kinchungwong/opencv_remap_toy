### Table - naming scheme for source gather functions

  - Byte size per arithmetic element (e.g. 1 = byte, signed or unsigned)
  - Number of arithmetic elements to be read consecutively from each row
    - Nearest: 1 x channels
    - Bilinear: 2 x channels
    - Bicubic: 4 x channels
    - Lanczos3: 6 x channels
    - Lanczos4: 8 x channels
  - Instruction load width per element (not necessarily same as arithmetic element)
    - epi8: 8-bit
    - epi32: 32-bit
    - epi64: 64-bit
  - Vectorization width (total width of a widest SIMD load)
    - SSE2, NEON: 128-bit
    - AVX2: 256-bit
    - AVX-512: 512-bit
  - Pseudo-vectorizations
    - When vectorization is not available, hard-coded hand-unrolled loads are used.
  - CPU capability flags
    - Post-SSE2 flags required for arithmetic processing (e.g. PMULLD requires SSE41)
    - Specific AVX-512 sub-flags required for arithmetic processing (e.g. BW, DQ, VBMI, VBMI2, IFMA)
